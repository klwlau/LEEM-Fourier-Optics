# Setup the object function in 2D FO Simulation

To setup the object function, user can config a numpy array (np.array) in `FO2Dsample.py`. 
The object funciton is called `simulatedObject` that is generated within a function called 
`create2DSimulatedObject()`. Alternatively, user can load the object function from a np.array file `.npy` that the user 
prepared separately. (A sample script is prepared in [here](#Loading-object-function-from-separate-file))  

the np array is generated during the simulation by create 2D simulated object in main()

During the simulation, the np.array `simulatedObject` is generated by running 
`create2DSimulatedObject()` within `main()` in `run2DFOSimulation.py`. 
Therefore, user **must** specify the array within `create2DSimulatedObject()` by generate it 
or loading a `.npy` file.

(**Note**: User have to make sure that the loaded np.array have the same dimension with `simulatingSpaceTotalStep` in `FO2Dsample.py`, because, within the `main()` function, the dimension of `simulatedObject` is not checked against `simulatingSpaceTotalStep` in `FO2Dconstants.py`.)
      

## Preview object function
To preview the object function user can run `FO2Dsample.py` by itself, a plot of `simulatedObject` is generated accordingly.

For example we generate a square step object with amplitude 1 with the object 0 outside:

```python 

def create2DSimulatedObject():
    # define a zero array with dimension simulatingSpaceTotalStep by simulatingSpaceTotalStep.
    # simulatingSpaceTotalStep definition is load by "from FO2Dconstants import *"
    simulatedObject = np.zeros((simulatingSpaceTotalStep,simulatingSpaceTotalStep))

    #define the square step object
    amp = 1
    simulatedObject[251 - 50:251 + 50, 251 - 50:251 + 50] = amp

    return simulatedObject

```


After that we run `FO2Dsample.py` in terminal:

    python FO2Dsample.py
    
Output:

## Loading object function from separate file


Here is a sample code for loading a object function stored in `objectFunction.npy` to the simulation.

```python 
import numpy as np

def create2DSimulatedObject():
    simulatedObject = np.load("objectFunction.npy")
    return simulatedObject

```
